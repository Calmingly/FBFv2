A lightweight Progressive Web App for a ~15-minute full-body routine inspired by:

## Run locally
Because this is a static app, serve it with any static file server.

Examples:
- `python3 -m http.server 4173`
- `npx serve .`

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

## Features
- Mobile-first single page workout flow
- Total timer and current-step timer
- Next / Previous / Start / Pause / Reset controls
- Local routine data in `data/fullBodyRoutine.json`
- PWA install prompt support
- Offline support via `sw.js` cache-first service worker

## PWA checklist
1. Open app once online.
2. Confirm manifest is loaded (`/manifest.webmanifest`).
3. Confirm service worker is active in browser devtools.
4. Switch browser offline and reload; app should still open.
